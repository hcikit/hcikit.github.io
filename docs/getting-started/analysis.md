Okay great. You've run an experiment and you have all of your logs in one file. So now you have a folder that has a bunch of files like:

```./logs
p1.json
p2.json
p3.json
...
```

But each log is in a really ugly format. It's very convenient for logging and saves us some space, but we really need to have this in a format we can put in Our Favourite Analysis Tool™© (obviously C++). Right now our logs look like:

```{json}
{

}
```
